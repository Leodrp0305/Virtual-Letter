# Virtual-letter
A personal project designed to work as a online letter. Even tho letters may feel rustic way of sending a message, it's undeniable that it has some charm in it, so in order to give it a modern twist I've made this project with intention of it being read. It's important to keep in mind that as i wrote this code expecting to be send to someone that reads portuguese, every aspect of the code that is possible written in Portuguese has been written in Portuguese.
